### Remote Procedure Call and Multiplex.

#### Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
* Read RPC readme.
* a protocol that one program can use to request a server from a program located on another computer on a network without having to understand the networks details.
* Call methods defined by a remote endpoint/server. I.E. Not always the best idea.

#### Multiplex
* Due to the limitations of the number of streams a browser can have at one time, multiplex is useful in that it allows us to send many streams over a single stream.
  * aka, you can only have so many outgoing connections in the browser.
